INTRODUCTION

This component demonstrates various features of the Intel I210 Ethernet 
controller. These features can be used for developing Audio/Video Bridging 
applications, Industrial Ethernet applications which require precise timing 
control over frame transmission, or test harnesses for measuring system 
latencies and sampling events.

This component - igb_avb - is limited to the Intel I210 Ethernet controller.  
The kernel module can be loaded in parallel to existing in-kernel igb modules 
which may be used on other supported Intel LAN controllers. Modifications are 
required to the in-kernel drivers if the existing in-kernel igb driver has 
support for the Intel I210.

BUILDING

The kernel igb module should be built which supports the latest Linux kernel
3.x PTP clock support - to enable, execute make with -DIGB_PTP
as a build option (e.g. make EXTRA_CFLAGS="-DIGB_PTP").

RUNNING

To install the kernel mode driver, you must have root permissions. Typically,
the driver is loaded by:
	<optional> sudo modprobe dca
	<optional> sudo modprobe ptp
	sudo insmod ./igb_avb.ko

As 3.4 and later kernels include support for the I210, you may need to 'rmmod 
igb' before loading the igb_avb module.

As the AVB Transmit queues (0,1) are mapped to a user-space application, typical
LAN traffic must be steered away from these queues. The driver implements one
method registering an ndo_select_queue handler to map traffic to queue[3]. 
Another possibly faster method uses the the transmit packet steering (XPS) 
functionality available since 2.6.35. An example script is below

#!/bin/bash

INTERFACE=p2p1
export INTERFACE

rmmod igb
rmmod igb_avb
insmod ./igb_avb.ko
sleep 1
ifconfig $INTERFACE down
echo 0 > /sys/class/net/$INTERFACE/queues/tx-0/xps_cpus
echo 0 > /sys/class/net/$INTERFACE/queues/tx-1/xps_cpus
echo f > /sys/class/net/$INTERFACE/queues/tx-2/xps_cpus
echo f > /sys/class/net/$INTERFACE/queues/tx-3/xps_cpus
ifconfig $INTERFACE up

You map also want to disable the network manager from 'managing' your interface. 
The easiest way is to find the interface configuration scripts on your distribution.
On Fedora 18, these are located at /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface>.
Edit the file to set 'BOOTPROTO=none'. This eliminates DHCP trying to configure the
interface while you may be doing user-space application configuration.
