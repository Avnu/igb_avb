INTRODUCTION

This component demonstrates various features of the Intel I210 Ethernet 
controller. These features can be used for developing Audio/Video Bridging 
applications, Industrial Ethernet applications which require precise timing 
control over frame transmission, or test harnesses for measuring system 
latencies and sampling events.

This component - igb_avb - is limited to the Intel I210 Ethernet controller.  
The kernel module can be loaded in parallel to existing in-kernel igb modules 
which may be used on other supported Intel LAN controllers. Modifications are 
required to the in-kernel drivers if the existing in-kernel igb driver has 
support for the Intel I210.

BUILDING

The kernel igb module can be built which supports the latest Linux kernel
3.x PTP clock support - to enable, modify kmod/Makefile and enable -DCONFIG_PTP
as a build option (e.g. EXTRA_CFLAGS += -DCONFIG_PTP).

RUNNING

To install the kernel mode driver, you must have root permissions. Typically,
the driver is loaded by:
	<optional> sudo modprobe dca
	<optional> sudo modprobe ptp
	sudo insmod ./igb_avb.ko

As 3.4 and later kernels include support for the I210, you may need to 'rmmod 
igb' before loading the igb_avb module.
